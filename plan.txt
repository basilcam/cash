functionality
=============

the shell is called camshell, abbreviated cash

the shell should offer the following functionality:
- when the user types ctrl+c, a SIGINT is forwareded to all fg processes
- when the user types ctrl+z, a SIGSTP is forwareded to all fg processes
- when a process terminates due to an uncaught signal, the shell should reap each child proces.
- jobs ending with a & should be run in the bg
- support for the following builtin commands:
    - exit
    - jobs 
    - bg 
    - fg 
    - source
    - kill
    - alias
    - help
    - export
    - echo
- boolean expressions (&&, ||)
- pipes to files (>)
- pipes for stdin/stdout/stderr (|)
- .cashrc file

approach
========

research how bash works


create a job data structure 
- it contains one process, job state (fg, bg), etc
- can eventually be extended to include multiple processes, pipes, etc

create a command data structure

maintain internal list of background jobs and <=1 foreground job

maintain internal list of aliases
