functionality
=============

the shell is called camshell, abbreviated cash

the shell should offer the following functionality:
- when the user types ctrl+c, a SIGINT is forwarded to all fg processes
- when the user types ctrl+z, a SIGSTP is forwarded to all fg processes
- when a process terminates due to an uncaught signal, the shell should reap each child proces.
- jobs ending with a & should be run in the bg
- support for the following cmd_type commands:
    - exit
    - jobs 
    - bg 
    - fg 
    - alias
    - help
    - export
    - echo
- boolean expressions (&&, ||)
- pipes to files (>)
- pipes for stdin/stdout/stderr (|)

approach
========

remember to block signals when accessing global stores in async-signal-safe handlers. also be careful around
the fork calls

signals are sent to the entire foreground process group (to cover spawned children). when we fork a process,
the pgid needs to be updated. otherwise it'd be the same as the shell's pgid and we'd kill the shell

we should restore signal handlers to the default after forking

notes
=====

the clion terminal does not support sending signals (i.e. sigint, sigtstp). you must start from an actual terminal

todo
====

keep track of last bg job, add +/- to bg job termination log

allow jid/pid to be specified for fg/bg commands

implement remaining builtins
- help
- export
- cd
- echo
- source
- alias

update libcam wrappers

implement file redirection

implement pipes
