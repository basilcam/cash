functionality
=============

the shell is called camshell, abbreviated cash

the shell should offer the following builtin commands:
- exit
- jobs 
- bg 
- fg 
- source
- kill
- alias
- help
- export
- echo

the shell should offer the following functionality:
- pipes for stdin/stdout/stderr (|)
- pipes to files (>)
- background jobs (&)
- boolean expressions (&&, ||)
- program resolution using PATH
- .cashrc file

approach
========

research how bash works

create a data structure to represent a given command
- use a class-style struct
    - consider using decorators
- break commands up into linked commands by booleans / pipes / 
  semicolons
- use enum for builtins

maintain internal list of jobs

maintain internal list of aliases
